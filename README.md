<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, people have become more conscious about living 'happily' and in a way that fulfills them. Whether that entails working to make the world a better place (and continuing a fight for justice for those of all races, genders, income levels, and so on), choosing to prioritize a work-life balance and selecting options that allow for flexibility in schedules, no longer wanting to work for minimum wage (and pushing for a liveable wage), taking the time to engage in 'self-care', or emphasizing mental health (and how it manifests) in the workplace and society as a whole, what constitutes 'happiness' is something I wanted to explore due to this prioritization prevalent today.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv'>The World Happiness Report</a> is one such source that monitors this by using data from the Gallup World Poll to 'estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.'</p>
<p>Another way to monitor this 'happiness' is to look into happiness scores for each country and compare them to factors indicative of (negative) mental health. Examples of this would include rates of depression, suicide, and substance abuse present in each given population. While I will not be investigating substance abuse and suicide rates in relation to mental health in this tutorial, it is something to take note of for the future.</p>

<p>Note: 'Happiness' can mean very different things. The <a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/happiness'>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a> defines it as 'a state of well-being and contentment' and/or 'a pleasurable or satisfying experience'. I will primarily be using the former definition when referring to this state of being. I would also like to mention that while I will be examining mental illness in relation to 'happiness', this does not mean that mental illness is a direct factor of 'happiness', or vice versa. Mental illness can be genetic, caused by factors not taken into account by the World Happiness Report, and so on.</p>
